# IRC-scripts
A few scripts for IRC via screen, irssi and ZNC

Powerupdown is a systemd shutdown script for ZNC which notifies users about a pending shutdown of the bouncer, used in conjunction with the other screen-irssi scripts to translate command line arguments to IRC and ZNC commands (as sort of the big example of what I use this for).  More scripts are to come.

Syntax for function usage is in code comments; a proper writeup is to come.
